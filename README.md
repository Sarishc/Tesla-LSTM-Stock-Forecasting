# Tesla-LSTM-Stock-Forecasting
Tesla-LSTM-Stock-Forecasting, utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict Tesla's stock price based on historical market data. By preprocessing and normalizing time-series data, the model identifies patterns in Tesla’s stock movements and provides forecasts that can aid in trend analysis

## Overview
This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to forecast Tesla (TSLA) stock prices. The model analyzes historical stock data to predict future price movements, providing insights for potential investment decisions.

## Features
- Historical stock data analysis and visualization
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- LSTM model implementation for time series forecasting
- Performance evaluation metrics
- Interactive visualizations of predictions vs actual prices
- Comprehensive technical analysis indicators

## Requirements
```
python >= 3.8
tensorflow >= 2.0

## Usage
1. Data Collection:
   - Historical data is automatically fetched using the yfinance library
   - Alternatively, you can use your own dataset in CSV format

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/stock_forecasting.ipynb
```

3. Execute each cell in sequence to:
   - Load and preprocess the data
   - Train the LSTM model
   - Generate predictions
   - Visualize results

## Model Architecture
- Input Layer: LSTM layers for sequence processing
- Hidden Layers: Dense layers with dropout for regularization
- Output Layer: Dense layer for price prediction
- Optimization: Adam optimizer
- Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)

## Results
- The model analyzes patterns in Tesla's stock price movements
- Predictions are generated for future price trends
- Performance metrics include:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - R-squared (R²) score

## Visualization Examples
- Stock price trends with moving averages
- Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, etc.)
- Predicted vs actual prices
- Training and validation loss curves
- Correlation heatmaps

## Limitations
- Stock market predictions are inherently uncertain
- Model performance depends on market conditions
- External factors may impact stock prices
- Past performance doesn't guarantee future results

## Future Improvements
- [ ] Implement additional technical indicators
- [ ] Add sentiment analysis from news/social media
- [ ] Experiment with different model architectures
- [ ] Create web interface for real-time predictions
- [ ] Include more feature engineering options
